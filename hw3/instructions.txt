Instructions

Using the example pages presented in the lecture (https://github.com/alexanderbock/webgl-examples), as inspiration, modify the examples to performs the following tasks:

1. Load a Wavefront OBJ file (https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wavefront_.obj_file) into vertex buffer arrays
   a. One option for a library to use for OBJ files is https://github.com/frenchtoast747/webgl-obj-loader but you are free to use any library
   b. You can use any freely OBJ model that is available, under the following conditions
      i. The model must be either submitted with the final result or available at a publicly visible URL for the grading
      ii. The model must contain texture coordinates and vertex normals
      iii. Apply any texture to the model (the texture must be either submitted with the final result or available at a publicly visible URL for the grading)
      iv. The model does *not* need to use other material properties
2. After the model has been loaded, implement Blinn-Phong shading in the fragment shader by making use of the normals and a static light direction. For this task, assume an infinitely distance light source, so that a single direction can be used for all fragments.
    a. Make it possible for the user to change the color of the light using three sliders for the red, green, and blue contribution.
    b. Add sliders to modify the ambient light, diffuse light, and specular highlight parameters

 

If you don't find suitable models on the web you can also use this example:
